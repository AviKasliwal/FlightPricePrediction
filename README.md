## Link to model : https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Gfhab66jC6LhGhfOmnN5rjm19aFEGy99?usp=sharing

### How to run the predictor?
1. Install Flask using pip
2. Download the repository
3. Make a folder inside `FlightPricePrediction` with name : `Models` and inside it save the `rf_regressor.pkl` file.
4. Now open the terminal and run app using `python3 app.py` or `python app.py`


**PS:** Could Not Deploy on Heroku as model size too large to upload on GitHub.
**PPS:** Will write about my solution after the examination. Keep `watching` the repo for updates.
